3 hours of culinary delights, brilliant service, fantastic cocktails and a great atmosphere. 
We ordered the tasting menu, one vegetarian, one with meat/fish, with cocktail pairing. This is highly recommended, then you really get to taste everything. 

NB: I'm not a vegetarian and love both meat and fish, but I didn't miss anything, and thought several times that the vegetarian dishes were even better than the meat dishes.

For example, the gravlax we had was paired with a dill-infused cocktail, which beautifully elevated the fresh, delicate flavors of the salmon. The herbal notes of the drink harmonized perfectly with the dish, creating a memorable and unique taste experience.

5,"Yes, yes, yes! In this place, everything fits together in every respect. My friend and I chose the elixir as an alternative to a ""girls' night"" to celebrate a birthday and we couldn't have chosen a better choice. We will certainly remember this visit for a long time. 
From the very entrance, the staff takes care of a very friendly atmosphere, so that you feel like you are with your friends at dinner, among others, by introducing the Eliksir crew and the Chef or revealing a few interesting facts about the restaurant.
We both chose the standard menu option with cocktail pairing - one with alcohol, the other without. Imagine our surprise when, after our first drink, we had doubts whether the free alcohol option was really 0% (of course it was). Be sure to stop by Eliksir to see that the world does not end with the virgin mojito, the non-alcoholic cocktails were just as surprising, more than once and more than their alcoholic equivalents.
Delicious dishes - phenomenally delicate tartare, delicate veal with a few seemingly simple but brilliantly selected additions and an amazing Kashubian tiramisu, in which the Italian classic perfectly harmonizes with the memory of childhood and the taste of strawberries from grandma's compote. Each dish combines different textures, which further enhances the taste experience.
If you are looking for simple, yet non-obvious and original combinations and at the same time an elegant place, but without a stiff atmosphere and pompousness, you couldn't have found a better place. I recommend Elixir! We will definitely come back here again. :)",Phenomenal experience and surprising food pairing with cocktails,,,F5201YBmarzenas,2024-09-28

The dishes served to us were taken care of down to the smallest detail, and the very nice Mrs. Zuzanna explained to us exactly what was on our plates. Her pleasant and sometimes funny anecdotes nicely expanded our knowledge and encouraged us to try things that we used to be reluctant to try (for example, in my case - fish). The whole picture of this heavenly dinner was complemented by alcoholic drinks served by Mrs. Gaja, who has great knowledge of her work and more than once pleasantly surprised us with what we found in the glass.

1,"Booked this restaurant for my friends 50th birthday.  I flew from Uk to Cork and then, my friends and I flew from Cork to Gdansk fro 4 days. 
I booked the restaurant for 7pm sitting.  Prior to leaving the UK. We travelled by taxi which took 45 mins from Gdansk old town rush hour. We were greeted by friendly staff. The restaurant  was empty with only 2 other tables having guests.  
We stat down and immediately our waiting staff came to us to say that there was nothing available from the grill menu due to sustainability meaning no chicken or beef dishes or anything from the main course grill section. That they only order a certain amount in.
I said we should of been contacted before arriving with this information and we were told they couldn't ring all customers. The restaurant is not that large and only 2 other tables had guests that evening. 
We were offered a small taster venue which had nothing on it that any of us would eat. This was so deveststing to here given the occasion. The staff then came back and said they may have 1 chicken. We said what do the other 2 eat? 
When we asked for the manager, he said he had 1 piece of beef belonging to the next day order that they could cut into 3.
I mean we were blown away by this from a michellin star restaurant.
He then proceeded to recommend another restaurant locally but at that point we decided to go back to Old Town Gdansk to try and make the evening special for my friends birthday. 
So by 7pm at a restaurant that is highly rated to have only taster menus available is shocking.
We were then left with 2 sizeable taxi fares.
Thankfully we got lucky at Chleb I Wino Gdansk who saved the day. 
We were given a zero alcohol bottle of something obviously no use to us given we were flying to Ireland the next day.",Check the menu is available before travelling. Shocking 7pm booking,"Cork, Ireland",Cork,gilliano913,2024-08-16

5,"When we initially started thinking about organizing wedding, the Eliksir didn't even come to our mind, as we didn't even know you could have a wedding there. Only after some time and dinner dates there did we realize that it was possible. 

The first thing that was important to us was the enormous help with organization. Mrs. Ewa was a perfect wedding planner and eased our minds from a huge part of wedding preparation. She presented us with a few selected great options from which we only need to choose. Of course, we could find florist, confectionery, photographer, musicians on our own, but it was pointless as it would take some time and we would not find better service providers than Eliksir has contacts with. Mrs. Ewa coordinated everything with service providers ‚Äì all communication, arrangements, for instance she made sure that everything we chose in the confectionery shop arrived at its place and that the room and tables were decorated. 

The menu selection was very simple, we could try all the options during the tasting as well as we were advised what works well for diverse audience, moreover we could have options to choose by guests for main courses, so we could have more extravagant option and one more safe. Our guests were shocked by the level of room decoration, the quality of food and drinks, as well as perfect food paring. 

Among our guests we had several people with allergies. The ability to adhere to individual restrictions and conscientiousness when serving those people their special dishes was astonishing. 

We have a large family, so we attended several weddings before our own. We can honestly say that we have never seen this level of service anywhere. The Eliksir crew was very efficient in serving dishes, helpful in case of questions, always vigilant and at the same time practically invisible. We are very grateful for your help, and we can wholeheartedly recommend Eliksir as a wonderful place to organize a wedding or wedding dinner. 

Thank you very much for making our wedding a carefree and wonderful day!",Perfect place for a wedding,,,Guide56131020591,2024-06-23

First of all, a place with a large selection of original cocktails and various types of drinks could only be a plus. What impressed me was the atmosphere, freedom and enthusiastic waiter service, especially thanks to Mrs. Marta and the rest of the team (sorry, I don't remember their names). We started the dishes with a delicious Martini cocktail, a good choice made us want more and more of such delicacies. In short, sturgeon tartare, Z≈Çotnicki bacon and Kashubian dessert will remain in our memory for a long time. There is a lot of emphasis on product quality. I HIGHLY encourage everyone to visit Eliksir.

The dishes served were underwhelming to say the least. Flavors were lackluster and presentation left much to be desired. The quality of the food was deeply disappointing, and the cocktail pairings, rather than elevating the experience, further detracted from it.

Each subsequent visit to Eliksir is a bull's-eye. My fianc√© and I visit Eliksir regularly and we never leave with any ""buts"". 

During our last visit, we tried the tasting menu with matching drinks. 

The current menu is a very successful modern interpretation of Polish cuisine. Delicate steak tartare without the slightest vein or piece of fat, sturgeon pate, light sour soup with pickled celery broth, bacon roast, rainbow trout fried without fat and a wonderful dessert - all this is a real feast for the senses, and especially for the palate. 

The service was well trained and polite, our waiter described the process of preparing each dish in a very interesting way and did not just list the ingredients. 

Eliksir W Bottle bartender syrups deserve additional attention - I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to prepare a good drink at home without much effort. My favorites are Basil Smash and Lime Sour. Of course, we stocked up before leaving.

Mark shared a lot of knowledge on bar equipment and ergonomics and, most importantly, on cocktail preparation. I prepared some of my favorite cocktails: Naked & Famous, Negroni (with a creative twist) as well as Whiskey Sour as the New York Sour version. Not only were the cocktails great but also the course made me feel like a true bartender for a bit! The vibes during the workshop were awesome and I had a lot of fun with Mark and the rest of the Eliksir team - to the extent that my wife and I stayed over for a couple of hours after the course just ordering drinks and enjoying ourselves.

Eliksir is the perfect place for a young couple who needs help organizing a party :) you can choose a comprehensive service and not worry about a DJ, photographer, room decoration, etc.

A big thank you to all Eliksir employees, because both in the planning phase and during the event, they did everything to make us happy with the results. Mrs. Ewa, event manager, advised us on every issue in the last (and most nerve-wracking :)) weeks, always stayed in touch with us, and approached the bride and groom's proposals very freely.

Applause also for the bartenders and waiters, because all orders were handled very efficiently, and there were a lot of us for such a place.

We were delighted with the food, the set menu formula is not for everyone, but if someone wants a wedding with original, high-quality food, they will not be disappointed. The same applies to the cocktails and alcohol served. Many of our guests had the opportunity to try something new, and they certainly did not complain about the portion size :)

4,"An unusual place. It combines original, very tasty and unusual drinks with food. My companion chose the vegan menu, and I chose the classic menu. She took the non-alcoholic pairing, and I did the opposite. In principle, one could comment that there is nothing to criticize, but at the same time it is difficult to howl with delight when it does not delight. The drinks are excellent! There was a long wait for the food, but it was ok - cakes and flowers beautifully painted on the plate and that's it. 
The decor is excellent, the service is discreet, the prices are more than dignified. what more could you want? Probably just to make it tasty and filling. The food was very disappointing for both of us. It would have been a 3 for the food, but the drinks were a 5 and it went up to 4.

The waiting time between the courses was extensive, we spent 5 hours there. The bill came with an added 10% service charge which I paid but later found out was not mandatory.

Dishes composed in such a way that they are not worth simply eating or swallowing. It is worth taking your time and trying to find what is hidden among the ingredients on the plate with each bite.

On arriving at 7.30pm we were early for our table but they took us without any problems as not busy being out of season and on a Tuesday.  Lovely  decor however it was a bit cold in the restaurant.  We decided on the 7 course tasting menu with cocktail pairing.  When the waiter came to take our order, we were told could not have the 7 course only the 5 course as it was too late in the evening.  This was a real problem as the 5 course menu had lamb which neither of us really eat.  I questioned why this was not mentioned at time of booking that we may not have the 7 course menu as we would have went elsewhere.  Never had this issue before at any other restaurants  we have been to.  We decided to go ahead with the 5 course menu and I changed my lamb course for pork.  Apart from the soup dish everything else was delicious, my partner had the lamb and was pleasantly surprised how nice it was.  The only other issue was we asked for water for table but never got it.  Cocktails were nice and change from the normal wine flights.  We would return but would like to try the 7 course menu.

The place is wonderful, the atmosphere, food and service are at the highest level. We were served by Mrs. Natalia, who professionally described each dish and advised what and how - it was our first dinner in this style :) we chose a pairing of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks for dinner, it was a hit, because each drink it complemented the meal wonderfully.

5,"An all around exquisite evening! 
We can report an outstanding culinary experience.
We ordered the tasting menus - 5 and 7 courses each. The 7 course menu also pairs with the cocktail. 

All courses were excellently composed and tasted delicious. 
It's difficult to highlight anything because everything was very good. 
The final dessert rounded off the menu more than worthy. 
My partner also had the cocktail pairing and there were good and very good cocktails. All the cocktails actually went very well with the food. 
In my opinion, two of the 5 cocktails were a bit too herbal, but this is a matter of taste, my partner liked them all.

There are no words that can describe the quality of the organization of the event, the care of the entire Eliksir Crew, and the ideas and amenities arranged directly for us. The food - it was madness. Attractions - a molecular show - an excellent form of entertainment, but we also received full support in organizing music.

4,"The starting point for Eleksir is very good, but unfortunately it falls a little short on the details. 
We love the concept and had high expectations for the experience. 
Unfortunately, Elixir doesn't reach all the way up. 

The menu looks very exciting on paper. We chose 7 dishes with accompanying cocktail pairings. 
The menu is very extensive and we struggle at times to distinguish between the size of what is a starter and a main course. We miss a greater balance and variety in the dishes in the menu, overall the dish had far too many dominant flavours. This means that you don't get as many opportunities to let your taste buds relax during the meal. The whole experience therefore becomes very overwhelming. 

The service was as expected, a bit slow service at times. We had to wait a while from the time we sat down until we got something good in the glass. 

We are of the opinion that there was a bit too much light on in the premises during our visit, it is one of the details which means that you do not get top results with us.","So close, but yet so fare away","Froland Municipality, Norway",Froland Municipality,thomashansen2015,2022-11-28

1,"November in Gdansk can be cold. Sitting on a old tram without heating for more than 20 minutes to get from the city to this restaurant is not fun, but one must sacrifice something for the sake if a good meal. I arrived at the restaurant five minutes before my 8pm reservation. The staff seemed somewhat puzzled by me appearing, as the restaurant was fully booked for some kind of happening. The head waiter (or whatever he was) came over, and after consulting his laptop he was able to confirm that I indeed had a reservation. Much to his surprise. Not that it helped, because they were full. So, I am currently in another cold tram returning to the city centre. And I am still hungry. He did seem genuinely sorry  and he tried offering me a table another night, but I am leaving. He offered me a bottle of champagne,  but as I have amply demonstrates in the past I have no problems in buying copious quantitites of alcolhol without any assistance. If I wanted to spend the night chugging champagne in my room all by my lonesome I could have saved myself the one hour round trip. The food may be delicioys  I have no idea. What is certain is that they have poor organizing skills. Do not trust the online reservation they offer through Open Table. I am hungry so angry hungry so angry.",Online reservation system is a joke,"Bergen, Norway",Bergen,Bilsatan,2022-11-15

It took long time to get the food and the waiter blamed us when we Didnt get our cocktails, he Said ‚Äùyou must understand that i asked you twice‚Äù, so just 2 out of 4 got their cocktails. So we had to order something else to drink (the waiter didnt Ask), we said we wanted wine and he suggested a primotivo. When the bottle came he said ‚Äùits cheap and not our best‚Äù, wtf?! As an excuse for bad service we got compensated through a discount of the service fee. Wow. Certainly an experience we Will never forget.

2,"I booked here for a romantic dinner with my girlfriend. Sadly it seems they had a very bad night.

The vaitors seemed very kind, showed us out table and gave us the menu.
We decided to go with the tasting menu and cocktail pairing.
The vaitor then told us that 7pm was too late for the tasting menu.
We then decided to go with the a la carte.

The starters arrived, and the vaitor forgot the white wine I ordered. And didn't realize it until it was done.
We ordered some bread, and asked to have another look at the wine menu.

We ordered the wine, and waited once again.

Our main dishes arrived, still no bread, and still waiting for the wine.
When I separated my stead it was overcooked and far from medium as ordered.
It took a few minutes before I got in contact with the vaitor, and since my girlfriend had to start eating her dish, and we wouldn't be able to enjoy dinner together anyway, I chose to just pay and leave.

I sincerely hope it was just a really bad night for them, but our dinner date was ruined.

Nothing special at all, I dont personally think it was tasting menu, it was home made food with weird combinations. We took the coctail paring and it was biggest mistake ever. The coctails looked good when ordered seperately, but paired coctails was something like combined all the warm left over boose and add some decorations. One coctail had vinegar in it and it was just very bad. I think the chefs are far away of cooking a proper tasting menu.

3,"I was soooo disappointed with the visit there as I was expecting something extraordinary and I was sooo looking forward to the visit. 

Me and my partner both ordered the vegetarian tasting menu with a selection of coctails - in the alcoholic and non-alcoholic version. 

First of all - kudos for having a vegetarian tasting menu. I really appreciate restaurants offering such options. 

Food: Unfortunately I am sad to admit that the food was... well, it was not ""bad"" but it was not good either. Nothing special, bland, the flavours in the dishes were not surprising, dishes lacked texture or even had an unpleasant texture (like the appetizer with asparagus which was weirdly slime'y in texture, or the ruby chocolate in the dessert which was gluey). The best part of the food is that, i have to admit, the vegetables were cooked perfectly. The asparagus, carrots, potatoes, really perfect texture. 

Coctails and pairing: 
Some of them were really delicious, some I didn't like at all but that's probably personal taste so that would have been fine. The issue I have is that the coctails did nothing to the food and vice versa. From the restaurant that specializes in pairing I expected more ""connection"" between the food and the drinks, like it can happen with food and wine. Second issue was that it turned out that the non-alcoholic coctails were actually made in the exact same way as the regular ones, just without alcohol. On one hand this is good - for the person not drinking % it gives the closest experience. On the other hand, without the alcohol addition the majority of virgin coctails were simply unbalanced and too sweet. 

Experience: the staff waiting on us was nice, but they all seemed a bit nervous all the time which at times created awkward atmosphere. It was correct, nothing bad happened, but also just doesn't convince me to go back there.","sadly, nothing special","Gdansk, Poland",Gdansk,majablanka,2022-07-04

Cocktails are experimental and executed till perfection. Every detail of cocktail is explained by knowledgeable staff and you'll have a private party in your mouth at first sip.

5,"For a long time, I heard good opinions about the place. Finally, I had a chance to go with a group of friends.

Cuisine ranges on the higher end of prices, but with the offered ingredients, it is reasonable.

For the dishes - we have ordered a tasting menu, one of which was vegetarian. Every person at our table was pleased.

The starters were almost perfect. Each was enjoyable the only caveat was that I did not get any taste from the first bite-sized piece. (Drink earlier might have killed it, but it was not a proposed cocktail pairing)
As for the main course - the first dish was exquisite. The second one was 'just' good.
The dessert - I did not eat a goat cheese for a dessert up to this point, but that panna cotta was fabulous, sorbet on the side was dreamy too.

Drinks. We ordered a variety of drinks I enjoyed each one. Deluxe options seem a bit overpriced.

The service was perfect. Our waitress explained each dish and cocktail. If we had any questions about the menu or place we were given a good, concise explanation.

But later we had the deer dish who was about the best slice of meat i ever tasted, the sauce was a perfect combo.
The rest of the dishes was just OK after that, and yeah the Coctails witch tasted in a wierd way like the dish it was served amongst, but none of them was likable, maybe the one who came in a copper mug.

5,"I'm a real whiner. I visit many restaurants (of various types) and there is always something to complain about. It's very hard in Elixir. My last visit (and I like going back there - although I have a piece) was literally in a class by itself. I liked everything! ALL! The reservation itself - the lady taking the reservation - understood my poor sense of humor +1, the table was not a bad one +2, I was greeted by a lady who showed me the whole place and what and where was very nice +3, I was also greeted by the manager of the place +4. The service was nice and unobtrusive - the lady who served me conducted a conversation tailored to the interlocutors (no stick - you know where) +5. To the point -> food - CLASS HERE! I don't eat meat or fish - I had a choice of delicious things - I chose Oyster Mushroom! - THE MOST DELICIOUS! , a dish that my loved ones also ordered MEGA + 6, even +8. 
But what I think appeals to me the most is the fact that it is a people-friendly place. I've eaten in similar places where the pompous staff frown when you're not wearing a tailcoat. Here I had the impression that no one was judging me - it was extremely important to me. This is Elixir for a medal. 
Due to the wonderful weather + EXCELLENT food (and the day before I had the opportunity to taste delicacies from a well-known chef and it was average), I am delighted! 
I recommend it to everyone. (if someone decides that the price is not right for them - I'll tell you right away that it's not for me either, theoretically - I left a few pennies in Eliksir - but it was money well spent)",A class of its own!,,,917filips,2022-04-25

Design: classic blues and jazz vibe with a rustic industrial theme. Perfect for a classic date.

staff: absolutely amazing and respectful staff. 

Price: I ate in a resto the previous night price was almost the same which is around 100-150/person with a 3-5 course meal. Here it was no comparison at all. An absolute steal for the food.

Food: this is when quality vs quantity would best express it, surprisingly I was just about full every course. they offered a treat for the palate prior to courses to optimise the taste. Veronika, who was waiting for us, was simply amazing in both polish and English and explained the menu thoroughly. My favorite was when she recommended the ginger desert, I was quite skeptical regarding the combination but lo and behold, she was 100% right.

We also tried some custom cocktails made on the spot by Matthew the bartender and they were just as good, if not better, than the ones on the menu.

4,"Of course, the ELIXIR had to be tried on ours
Mini holiday. The restaurant everyone is talking about. We had high expectations and they were fulfilled to that extent with a gastronomic experience. The place markets itself a lot on their 'cocktail pairing' for the tasting menu which we tried. Unfortunately, we never got the wow experience at their cocktails. Whether it was because they did not suit the dishes or whether we lacked an introduction to what we were about to experience, we do not know.",Tasting menu with cocktails,"Vejle, Denmark",Vejle,jonassJ6444EJ,2022-01-13

1,"Waiter mixed up orders, which is a pity when we have a pregnant lady with allergies. Meat was uncooked, when I specifically asked for well done meat or I would happily switch to vegan option. We spend 4hours there, mostly because it took so long to prepare the food and yet they still managed to forget about one person. While they have info online, that there is option for take out, we could not do so. Also there was no choice for dessert... After not eating my main, and all portions being tiny, I came home hungry as I had no time to order anything else. Waste of time and money.",I don't know where the good opinions come from,,,ni_k597,2021-12-15

2,"Booked table for Saturday evening and got no info that, on weekends, they just do tasting menus (we were planning to go a la carte). We accepted the circumstances and then ordered the five dish tasting menu. Oh my, what a waste of money!

It took us around three hours to go thru them all and still left hungry. The wait averaged 20-30 mins p/ dish, thou it was just a couple of bites. I mean the food is tasty, but all the dishes are quite similar. They are made to look complicated, but I didn‚Äôt see any special or noteworthy technique.

The cocktail pairing is also not worthy. The drinks are really tiny, and you really have to make an effort to make them last a few sips. 

The service was very good. But you won‚Äôt be seeing us again.",Waste of money,,,zemiszemis,2021-12-05

After one cocktail, we moved to the main room and Mrs. Sylwia took over. We chose the tasting option and it was a hit. My friend had additional cocktails to go with the dishes. Nothing to add.

2,"We unfortunately had a very bad experience at Eliksir, we tried hard to like it but there were just too many things that were very disappointing.

We had pre-ordered the 7 dishes tasting menu with cocktail pairing and had asked for a change of one dish, they mentioned when doing this that the charge would be an extra 25 z≈Ç or person, which was fine, the menu on the website show the following ‚ÄòEvery change in tasting menu must be agreed with the staff and it is extra 25 z≈Ç per each.‚Äô However when we paid it turned out that the change cost 25 z≈Ç plus the price of the dish we changed too, this would have been fine had it been mentioned anywhere beforehand but like this it was an unfortunate surprise at the end of a bad evening.

Although the whole menu had been pre-ordered, the waiting game now began. We arrived at 7.30 pm and didn‚Äôt leave until 0.30 am. 5 hours for 7 dishes and 2 small dishes, is just way way too long.

The food was not bad, but only a few dishes were actually good, the rest were bland and lacking different textures, a lot of the dishes were just soft elements.

The cocktail pairing they very obviously ran out of the right glasses, a lot of the cocktails were red and served in the same glasses again and again it turns into a repetitive experience of red cocktails.

The wait between dishes took a lot out of the mood, the last two dishes we waited 1 hour for each, we mentioned the wait before the dessert and were told the kitchen would be ready when they were ready and that there was nothing the waiter could do, after this we preceded to wait for 1 hour for the dessert.

The palette cleanser we got before the dessert, was a blurb of ‚Äòsorbet‚Äô placed in a tea candle holder, not in anyway presented nicely.

All in all this was very dissatisfactory, disappointing and too expensive for the service we received.",A very long and disappointing night,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen,MathildeH104,2021-11-28

As a bit of a fussy eater I wasn't sure the tasting menu would be for me but my boyfriend persuaded me.  I really enjoyed all the dishes and left feeling really quite full!
