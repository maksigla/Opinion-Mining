We ordered food but the longer we sat the more annoyed I got as other couples where getting tables  whilst we where dumped and ignored at the bar so I asked the bartender to cancel our order as we where going  to leave 5 min later we got given a table .

Very friendly and helpful when we were choosing from the menu. We shared ribs and wings between 4 to start and this was plenty. For our mains we had the sharing meat platter for 2, a steak on the rock and classic ribs - all were excellent! The sugar snap peas and tomato side was also delicious.

He had steak with a side of burnt finger. As its nearing to Halloween they had Michael Myers running around the place causing havoc which to be honest was the highlight of my break. Lovely spooky vibes and top music. Only negative was you accessed the menu online and couldn't really make out as it was in polish but the waitress Isobel sat down and went through it with us, she was lovely and so helpful and i have recommended my sister go there as she's in Gdansk at the moment.  I also had a lovely hot cocktail called cherry choco which was served hot in a mason jar and was delicious.

The alcohol selection wasn‚Äôt great but sufficient. We ordered the steak that served in a sizzling platter. we made sure to order the steak cooked one level of doneness  below what we really like because it continues to cook on the platter. we ordered the top grade steak and it was worth it. We cooked it to perfection and it was so tender and flavorful.

Then I ate a tomahawk, while the wife went for spareribs. Excellent quality on both dishes. The tomahawk was a little more expensive than anticipated since I chose beef instead of pork. 

Day 2 we each went for our Jim Beam supreme Burger. Goes straight into the top 3 list of burgers!! Strongly recommended. This day we were served by Simon.

3,"Cool premises and concept, but that's where it stops. The food/meat did not live up to expectations in any way. Few tempting sauces, so we went for spiced butter. When the food finally arrived, the meat was cold, so the spice butter did not melt. Boring accessories to choose from too. 
The venue was also extremely smoky. It was so gray that you could hardly see the end of the room. 
The smell of smoke and frying settled in all clothes and hair and was so thick that guests started coughing. Here, something seriously needs to be done with fans in the kitchen. It's boring to wear smelly outerwear for several days afterwards. 
For being a meat restaurant, it is also too bad that no meat/beef is offered on the children's menu. The children took a burger, but this one was not entirely to their taste either.",Bragging stuff,"Drammen, Norway",Drammen,fluanel,2024-10-03

The weather was good enough to sit outside and eat which as a bonus looking into the buildings and water.

When we first arrived two members of staff greeted us friendly explained we could sit anywhere which we did. One member of staff came back and asked us to move so they could link two tables together which we accommodated and our server would be over soon.

The downside we experienced was we waited a while and felt like we were being ignored, the table that sat at originally came in sat down and got served before us, which we didn‚Äôt understand. 

The server eventually appeared after we asked for our order to be taken as we had waited patiently.

It then appeared the server was dealing with a large rowdy group of men a few tables away from us and they were getting priority also.

It was unfortunately a big mistake as we basically felt robbed of the price based on what we got on the plate. Among other things, we ordered one of the most expensive cuts of meat (SEK 660) and expected fireworks. What did we get??? Read below.

+ Good pornstar Martini
+ Nice view and cozy place to sit
+ Live music

- Realized after paying that the waitress charged extra for our choice of potatoes even though it was included
- Disengaged waitress who got mad when we didn't want to tip 
- Serve cold on the cob
- Potato wedges only doughy
- the meat that was cut up was served cold and one part was fried Well Done while the other part was fried Medium. 
- Didn't get to choose sauces for this dish, but got a tasteless sauce and a sauce that tasted only of mustard (?!?)
- We had to wait 15 minutes to order drinks.
Then the drink came after another 10 min. Then ordered food. The food came after 50 min. Luckily we weren't super hungry during the visit üôÑ

We ordered 
2 x soft drinks
2 x drinks
1 x grill mix (their most expensive meat dish)
1 x Viking (would be a delicious meat)

At first it reminded me of a ""Hard Rock Cafe"" and I was a bit sceptical. But when we went further in and I saw the dry-aging cabinets up in the ceiling I was looking forward to see the menu. All the way from Wagyu to Tomahawks.

I ordered a Viking Steak, 280g from the middle part of beef sirloin. Served on a hot stone, this is one of the best experiences I have ever had when eating steaks out at restaurants.

They gave us some free sample of Tartar, and it was really good.

After the dinner we ordered a drink called Strawberry Hugo Skull XXL. It was served in a huge skull and it both looked and tasted really nice!
We shared this as a couple.

We concluded that maybe the loud rock music would be a little bit too mutch for older people, but we loved it.

The steak arrived. I had asked for medium. The middle was cold and raw. Seriously? The steak was sent back and came back still raw in the middle! I can only guess the chef brought his kids to work and let them cook.
They offered shots as an apology which I don‚Äôt drink. Then charged full price , 3x the price of t advertised ‚Äúpork ‚Äú tomahawk!
Didn‚Äôt have the decency to reduce the price of the raw steak which I never finished.

Because, the food is really great!  Fantastic wings were spicy but not hot with the BBQ sauce, pork tomahawk was great and that cherry jar drink was yummy.

2,"My partner and I were very excited to visit this restaurant, it ticked all the boxes! We couldn't wait to try the steaks and the cocktails. Unfortunately, the service is appalling!! I don't normally write reviews but felt like I had too!!! 

We tried to book but we were told to come back and queue (like most restaurants in Gdansk). We were find with this, we were happy just to get a table. We sat inside around 19:00 and noticed that there were quite a few empty tables inside (most people chose to sit outside). We had to wait around 20 mins before we decided to speak to one of the waitresses and we were told that 'Nathalia' would be right with us. Again, we waited another 20 mins (at this point gasping for a drink!) to be told that 'Nathalia' is our waitress and that she'll be right with us. We waited again for a further 10 mins but noticed Nathalia walk by, so we grabbed her and asked if we could order some drinks, she said that she wasn't our waitress but she would take our order anyway!!!!! No apology at this point. 

We had to wait another 20 mins or so for our drinks (at this point I was getting very frustrated and we did nearly leave) but she eventually turned up with some drinks and took our order. We shared the steak platter (and the steak was great!) and asked for onion rings and chips but it came with sweet potato fries and chips!!! So they even got our order wrong too. 

Before the meal we ordered some more drinks (knowing how long these take) but these turned up about half hour after we finished our meal!!!

It was a very frustrating evening. You don't mind waiting a little bit but this was just ridiculous. There was no apology and they got our order wrong. 

We really wanted to try some of the cocktails but we decided to leave. If the service was improved this place could be amazing... such a shame!

Enter at your own risk... if your waitress is called Nathalia you are in for a very long night!!!",Very poor service!! Only go if you have hours to kill!!,"Rowlands Castle, United Kingdom",Rowlands Castle,FarAway01923544833,2024-06-05

2,"Have reviewed here twice before ...burgers were great on the first occasion at the original location. Last time the lack of a physical paper menu ruined it for us. The menus were hard to see on our device. You couldn't flip back and forth between starters and main for example as they downloaded separately. Said we wouldn't go back.

But thought we'd have another go as we visit Gdansk so regularly.

No queues this time and the server was friendly, but we asked at the 'wait to be seated' sign' if they had paper menus yet.
No. They don't have them and no workaround was offered.

On our holidays we like to enjoy them without carrying our phones around. Maybe not the hip and trendy thing to do, but this is us and many, many more people who come for complete relaxation. The lack of physical menus means that Whiskey in the Jar is a no go area.

2,"We were 6 friends on a trip who had to book a table in advance. They should have 600 zlotys for that (NOK 1,663). Something we would get back / deducted from the bill.  This did not happen and was instead added to the bill!   So we simply paid 1200 zlotys. We also had one with a brush.  This meant that the waiter just kept bringing drinks to the table without us having asked for it! This was also added to the bill!  Something that is very rude!!  We were there 1 year ago and were incredibly happy with the whole place.  This year the menu was very shrunk!  The drinks were also smaller this year at the same price / if not more expensive.

1,"So "" Whiskey in the jar "" came up as the best place for a steak according to some Gdansk FB page my wife belongs too ... 
We booked a table for the Saturday evening and turned up right on time ...the place was heaving , noisy and staff running all.over the place !!!! Not a place nowadays I'd normally bother going to but heh when in Rome .. menu was via a QR code , pain in the arse !!! 
Ordered the drinks and to be fair they came fairly quickly. We ordered the food through I must say a decent enough waitress. 
The food came out , looked good and we began to eat . My wife's chicken burger was STONE COLD !!!!! 
My meal was fine so I carried on eating,  we called over the waitress and explained the situation to which she apologised and organised a replacement.  By the time it came out I'd finished so the whole meal was ruined . We got the bill , they reduced it for the shambles and we left ...

3,"We ordered ""grill premium mix"". Where we were supposed to taste different meats - we never got to know what the different meats were. 

We had not pre-booked a table either, which was fine as we got a table quite quickly (it was already fully booked). When we sat down, we got a menu via QR code, which is easy and simple, but the page took around 3 minutes to download, which was a bit tricky

When we ordered, it took around 40 minutes for the food to arrive, and the first two (no idea what it was) were ok+. The last one was supposed to be medium rare(?), but was probably closer to raw... it was also more fat than meat, which is usually fine for me, but didn't taste good this time. It probably tastes better to others than us.

1,"BAD SERVICE. RUDE STAFF. AVERAGE FOOD. TOURIST TRAP. 
Avoid being served by the tattooed, black haired woman that handles the 2nd floor. We arrived at the same time with a couple that sat beside us and our main course arrived by the time the other couple was leaving. We arrived at 19:00 and had the main course served at 20:21. I didn‚Äôt know what the waitress was thinking, but clearly, she wasn‚Äôt the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree.
The spicy chicken was quite cold when it reached our table, and so was the mini bucket of fries. The meat was okay. Would‚Äôve been good if the resto could actually manage a large number of customers, so the waiters could do their tasks properly.  Rude staff and bad service is a bad combo.",RUDE STAFF.

2,Even though we made a table reservation well in advance of our visit we were kept waiting for a long time along with about ten other customers upon arrival. None of the staff seemed to care about all the waiting customers. After a long while we were finally taken to a table upstairs where we were told to scan a QR code to access the menu. The food menu was offered in English but the drinks menu was available in Polish only. After placing our orders around ten past seven the drinks and starters were delivered shortly after but once we'd finished the starters nothing much happened. We tried to order more drinks while waiting for the main course but were rudely brushed off by a black haired heavily tattooed waitress who clearly didn't feel like interacting with her customers. Only later did she return to our table to take our drinks order. Then nothing happened again until an hour later when the rude waitress returned to inform us that they needed another four minutes before the main course would be ready. At this point in time my wife was ready to leave but about twenty minutes past eight the main course finally arrived. The steak fries along with the corn on the cob and the mushroom sauce were cold and my steak was over cooked given that I'd ordered it rare. Needless to say the visit was a disappointment. All in all the restaurant is a rather sad clich√© pretending to be an American style place for poodle rockers and wannabe cool employees who seem to think that as long as they're dressed in all black and covered in tattoos anything goes. Do yourself a favour and visit one of the many other restaurants in Gdansk that actually offer good food and decent customer service.

We sat next to a huge aquarium, which my 5-year-old daughter admired.  We were served by Mr. Szymon, who reminded me what great service is. He was smiling, gave great advice and we felt as if we had known each other for a long time and not seen each other for the first time. He made this dinner special. Of course, the food was also top notch. Starting from soup with meatballs, which my daughter ate, to steaks and burgers. The burgers are so big that we had no room for dessert. Mr. Szymon surprised my dad with a small birthday gift. It was very nice, thank you again. As the name suggests, the restaurant offers a wide selection of whiskeys, but the wine selection was surprising.

Ordered 2 burgers and spare ribs, you can only order one size of spare ribs, 500 g, including legs, so would recommend a starter if you choose this one.

3,"I had previously visited Wiskey in a Jar some months ago and had a very good impression. I had a memory of a lively place with good ambience and nice food. I decided to visit when I was in Gdansk again. 
It was kind of a strange experience. It must have been a slow night as there were only about 25-30% of the tables occupied inside. Despite of this I was taken upstairs to a kind of balcony overlooking the rest of restaurant. Some tables away was a party with a dog that kept barking loudly at random intervals. A couple of tables away on the other side was a young couple. We were the only guests on the balcony. 
I ordered my food which arrived very fast. It happened when a waiter literally threw the food on my table and with a very loud cry of joy ran to the young couple at the nearby table, where he threw himself on top of the young girl sitting there. She also screamed (understandably) and a lot of commotion followed. They were obviously friends. 
I understood that the balcony is where ""odd"" guests are seated. I resent being treated as ""odd"" just because is am visiting a restaurant s√≥lo.
The food was OK, so that was at least something. But I would prefer if the livelyness is due to happy customers, not barking dogs and loud staff. ",Disappointing second visit,"Cadiz, Spain",Cadiz,Buysomething,2023-10-02

Magda turned out to be not only a professional waitress, but also a person with a huge heart. Her smile and positive approach to work made a huge impression on us. She was always available to help us choose dishes and drinks, advising the best flavor combinations.

Her attention to our needs was unparalleled. Our glasses were always full and our plates were cleaned with precision. Even in the busiest moments, Magda remained calm and professional.

However, what makes Magda stand out is her friendliness and kindness. With her, our visit to the restaurant became not just a meal, but a real experience. She made us feel welcome and appreciated.

Magda is a real treasure for your restaurant. Her passion and commitment to work are admirable. We can't wait for our next visit and hope that Magda will be our waitress again.

The food was excellent! I had bbq ribs with corn and fries for sides and I couldn't leave a crumb behind. The Chinatown sour I had wad also delicious and was perfect with the food.

When the bill came it was over ¬£300! I've never had a more expensive meal. I had to put it on my credit card but it wasn't explained the price of this recommendation otherwise i would never have ordered it.

5,"Legitimately one of the best burgers I've ever had. I was able to get seated quickly on a Saturday night even though they had a decent crowd built up. My waitress Julia was super awesome and did a great job with making sure food and drinks were timely and followed up with making sure if I wanted another drink (some places don't ask and I prefer when they do, personally). Definitely have to recommend this place! I wasn't going to come until the night of my birthday because they had nice steaks, but ultimately decided to come tonight and the Diablo burger sounded better, and I'm not unhappy about choosing a burger over a steak lol. I feel their steak prices were fair though, especially since they seem to be quite large steaks (9oz for the smaller one for my fellow Americans). Also I've been traveling in Europe for several months and it was nice to feel at home a little here, reminds me of Smoky Mountains Tennessee area but with rock music playing.
 Overall, I definitely recommend and would return!",Definitely come here while in Gdansk!,"Saint Louis, Missouri",Saint Louis,serenecat1,2023-07-01
