3,"It‚Äôs baked potatoes. That you eat with a fork only. No knife offered. 
This place lost me when they sat us right by the door in a draft (Gda≈Ñsk in mid Nov isn‚Äôt warm!) and then I realised they could have sat us in a cosier place towards the back. 
The food was ok but the service was poor. Food felt a bit dumped in front of us. We had to ask for our bill and it felt like we were doing all the legwork. It‚Äôs a small restaurant so more attention to detail needed.
Like someone else said, I wonder if once they realised you‚Äôre a tourist you‚Äôre not top tier.",An ok experience.,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,kenobi,2024-11-22
2,"Everything seemed to change when I asked for menus in English.
I said hello and explained that we had a reservation, in Polish.
I had made the reservation mostly in Polish, too.

But I am not that confident to translate a whole menu for my wife. 
If it was just me, I would maybe just chance it with the Polish menu, but my wife needs reassurance that she understands what she is  ordering. So, I asked for menus in English and the atmosphere changed.

The food took ages to arrive and when it did, the chips were cold, as if they had been left standing.

Drinks did not turn up.
I spoke to the waiter several times on the way past to attract his attention but he ""did not hear me"".
Eventually, I went to the counter and asked about the drinks. Grudgingly, he brought them over. I am not sure if one of the beers was one that another table had already sent back for being wrong. I saw a member of staff taste it.

Cold chips (French fries). 
Nobody bothered to ask if everything was OK. By this time, we had decided to just power through and get out of there.

Same problem as before trying to get attention of the waiter to ask for the bill. It is not a big restaurant. It would be impossible for waiter not to hear me on the way past.

So, I went to the counter again. At thix point they asked iv everything had been OK. I said no, the chips were cold. No response. 

Paid the bill and escaped.

All in all, quite a weird experience and not very pleasant.

In the meantime, we signaled to the waitress that we were waiting for a bottle of wine. When we finished our dishes, another waitress (bartender) came over with glasses of wine. We were amazed that poured glasses were brought to our table. We politely explained to the lady that if you order a bottle of wine, the server should bring the bottle to the table and I should open it in front of everyone. The bartender didn't even apologize and said that...that's how they serve it..., turned around and left. Unfortunately, she didn't bring the bottle as we ordered and she was probably offended at us.

Try 4 season tea, big glass with tea and fruit, very good.

The only problem was we were told to go to the underground floor because there were very few floors, and to get there you have to go out and enter thru a different door. It‚Äôs basically not connected. And they have no idea of how is the other floor doing, so when we got there it was super crowded and you could barely walk/move. The staff was incredibly rude and we were ignored not only before, but also while trying to talk to the guy behind the counter. He gave us short and rude answer with barely looking at us. 
So we went upstairs again, and this time was even more full so we got the last table which was in a pretty awkward place. Anyways, before our food was served someone else left and we could take their place.

2,"Tempted by the positive reviews on Tripadvisor, we decided to go to the above-mentioned restaurant. Unfortunately, only the decor and quite nice service made a positive impression on us.
The pleasant atmosphere ended after receiving the ordered flounder with fries and salad and a ""healthy"" baked potato. Let's start with the fladra: we received three or four very thin breaded fillets that, when we tasted them, did not resemble fish at all. The flounder must have been frozen because it turned into a coated mush which, interestingly, probably tasted like potato pancakes previously fried in the same fat. Additionally, both the fish and fries were very grease-soaked. The sauerkraut salad was ok. 
Now let's move on to the potato. I ordered the version with grilled vegetables (according to the menu: peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, carrots, beans) + lettuce and sprouts. After receiving the potato, it turned out that the ordered ""grilled"" vegetables were nothing more than purchased, ready-made vegetables for frying for about PLN 4. Unfortunately, they were not grilled at all, but only thrown into a pan and fried with a lot of fat. For these reasons, we strongly advise against visiting this place. We didn't expect any culinary revelations, but these dishes are not suitable even for an ordinary dinner.",We do not recommend!,,,claudiarJ3577AS,2019-03-24

Welcomed by very polite and pleasant staff and we were offered a large menu of pretty much baked potato with a huge variety of toppings. 

What arrived was superb! I had the chicken breast with the ketchup sauce which was huge and so tasty. My travel buddy had the Hungarian sausage with a garlic sauce which was equally as good. Really hearty meals with high quality of taste that we weren‚Äôt expecting from just a potato. Red wine and a pint of beer and in all it care to 83 zloty (¬£16).

1,"Taking into account the overall number of positive opinions while visiting Gda≈Ñsk, we were tempted to visit the above-mentioned bar. Bar. Because the owner himself doesn't call it a restaurant. And all in all, that's good. My companion and I ordered a potato with gorgonzola and bacon, as well as trout with potato chips and grilled vegetables, and mulled wine to drink. And this is where the problems started. After 10 minutes of waiting, they started loading drinks on the tables taken after us, and there was silence. After the warning, the waitress disappeared somewhere in the back and reappeared only after another 15 minutes, both dishes and drinks. Trout. Two thin fillets with a completely light breading color and completely unseasoned. Zero taste. In fact, the only thing that added flavor was the damn artificial garlic sauce. That's nothing yet. Even though the potato was warm inside, the cheese didn't melt or anything. Even though it was described on the menu as ""gorgonzola"", it didn't even resemble it. But there was 3 times too much of the cheapest something resembling cheese. Plus bacon, raw, thrown into the dish just to heat it up. Massacre. The potato itself was very good, but the excess of this ""cheese"" killed everything, even the appetite. In addition, at the end it was strongly pointed out that you simply couldn't eat it, and the waitress just nodded, said she would pass it on and after a minute the bill landed on the table.

The waitress served three tables that came after us without even looking at us. Generally speaking, the waitress walked around the room with a suffering face as if she was at work as a punishment. At 8 p.m. we left and politely thanked her for the delicious food ;) 
In July, I had a similar situation - when the waitress saw that we had entered the room 40 minutes before the kitchen closed, she whispered vulgar words to her friend which, unfortunately for her, we heard.

4,"Let me start by saying that we wanted to eat good fish in Gda≈Ñsk and Google suggested that we could eat it at ""Bar pod RybƒÖ"". (The name itself suggests it.) When it comes to fish, the menu is unfortunately disappointing, because we only have 4 items to choose from, and all of them come in the form of fried/baked fillet. Dinner dishes include flounder, cod, salmon and trout. A bit small for a pub called ""Bar pod rybƒÖ"". However, there are probably 40 potato items :). So we ordered cod fillet and Mexican potato pancake. DELICIOUS cod. Really very good fish, fresh. Way to go. However, the Mexican cake was very disappointing. The ""content"" of the cake had nothing to do with Mexico. The meat was rubbery, the sauce was filled with tomato paste... seriously, just give up on something like this. It would be better if you invested more in fish. I would love to eat some appetizers, e.g. herring. Unfortunately, nothing here.

Funnily enough, the people next to us who came later also came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãordering fries while waiting for dinner and were served within 15 minutes.
And coming to the point - the food was not worth the price or the wait: the potato with cabbage tasted like bigos and the potato pancake had not only a sauce so fatty that it was inedible, but also salmon (which is why we chose this dish, wanting to try it at a fish bar). -fish) was of the worst quality, not tasty, I ate better ones bought in grocery chains.",Waiting time 2 hours - for the most persistent,,,283aniau,2018-05-06

This restaurant serves the best (filled) potatoes I have ever eaten. There is a huge selection of fillings and at about ‚Ç¨5 per serving, you certainly get your moneys, worth. 
I orderd a mushroom and gorgonzola filling and my wife a chees and bacon filling. Bothe were equally delicious.

We both really enjoyed our baked potatoes and beers in here before we moved on and for a first time visit we were very impressed with this great restaurant so much so that we came back later on in the week were we enjoyed some great beers sitting out on their great terrace that offers great views of Ul Piwna.

1,"Rarely have I found myself faced with such regrettable treatment by staff who work in front of the public. I relate the facts:
We are a couple sightseeing in Gdansk and we went into this place to eat (around 2 in the afternoon). We asked for a table for two, they reluctantly showed us a table and there we sat, waiting for them to bring us the menu cards. After a few minutes, other diners arrive and sit at a table next to us and bring them the menu cards instantly. Other diners come, and the same thing. Since they don't bring it to us, I call the waitress to ask for them and she doesn't pay any attention to us. Since we were already there for about 15-20 minutes without them paying attention to us, we got up and left.
I can't rate the food because I didn't try it, but I can say that the treatment received at this place was deplorable. I still don't understand the reason for this treatment and how you can have that type of unprofessional staff working.

2,"We came to Gda≈Ñsk from the other end of Poland, so as you can easily guess, we were hungry after a long journey. We chose Bar pod rybƒÖ mainly because it was the closest to our place of accommodation. After entering the place, it turned out that it was quite crowded and, according to the principle ""if there are a lot of people, it must be good"", we decided to stay. It was a mistake, a big mistake. At the very beginning, the waitress informed us that there was no beef, gorgonzola cheese, flounder, trout, a total of about 5-6 ingredients from which the entire menu largely consists. A bit of a strange situation considering that it was 15/16. As the May weekend was quite cold this year, we wanted a warming soup. As the menu says, ask the waitress about the soup of the day. The answer totally blew us away: cold soup! There are no others to choose from. We accepted it and decided to order tea, mulled wine, stuffed potato and Gypsy potato pancake. After the waitress reminded us, we waited 25 minutes for tea, 40 minutes for mulled wine, and about 60 minutes for main courses. The dishes themselves were very average, but the portions were large.

I can only comment on the potato pancakes since we had both. The pancake is actually a mega pancake made with eggs, potatoes and flour, cooked in plenty of oil and stuffed beyond belief. I took a vegetarian one with only vegetables precisely because I wanted to stay light, but instead I wasn't able to finish the dish: in addition to various types of vegetables on the outside, inside the pancake there was a somewhat nauseating filling made of vegetables cooked with something indefinite that gave the whole thing a yellowish appearance. My boyfriend got one with pork, but even then it was very stuffed. I confirm the reviews of those who spoke of excessive (and unmotivated) use of pepper. They are certainly cheap dishes that don't make you leave the place hungry, but I think that in this case it's not really a positive aspect.

3,"We went there based on the TripAdvisor rating and the location. The location is very good and the prices, considering such a good location, are very competitive.

When it comes to the taste of the dishes, we have no major reservations, except that the dish becomes too monotonous towards the end.

However, in the case of service, we were disappointed. The waitresses often made mistakes (and not only at our table). Every now and then they were running around explaining that someone had made a mistake with the sauce or that a key ingredient was missing in the ordered dish. In our case, when we ordered kvass, which according to the card was supposed to be 0.5L, we received 0.3L. Only when we asked why it was different from the one we ordered, the waitress explained that they did not have 0.5L kvass and only sold 0.3L. This information should be provided when placing an order, not after receiving an open bottle.","It's not bad, but there is a lot of room for improvement","Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw,mateuszkarwat,2017-07-01

My main course was half finished, it turned out that the dish was 'almost' arriving. However, this turned out not to be the case. The people who came far after us got their dishes, unfortunately we did not. After waiting half an hour, the main course was finished and there was nothing on the table for the others.

The food was good although I must say that it was a bit meager (instead of one large potato there were two small ones). The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, even more so because it was raining and a bit cold outside. The treatment of the staff seemed correct to me. Nothing to object about.

Baked potatoes with stuffing. Only a few dozen types!! The first time I was there, I was blown away. Potato ? with stuffing? What am I in Austria? Or in ""Pyrlandia""? Well, since I took up the challenge of tasting it, let's get started. I immediately attacked MIX, i.e. two flavors. And so it began.... Perfectly prepared and seasoned. The portion is so big that you can barely eat it, but since it's so tasty, you'll keep fighting until the end. 
Since then, whenever I have the opportunity to be at ul. Piwna In Gda≈Ñsk, I try new flavors and they never disappoint. As I get closer to ticking off all the flavors, new ones appear.

The menu includes over 30 baked potato options. This is just a lot of scope when choosing a dish! The choice fell on the Mexican potato and ""oli"". The beef in the Mexican was soft and the whole thing was seasoned very positively (spicy, but without muffling the kebab flavor). As for the potato oil, it is delicately mild while retaining the flavor of vegetables and chicken. The potato itself, which took the lead, was baked soft.

I understand that he may have just been learning, but the mistake must have occurred when placing the order and another person picked it up. After 10 minutes of waiting, a third person brought the bill. The restaurant agreed to a 10% discount (we had to suggest it ourselves), which I consider a plus, but the service was not the best that day, and it's not just about the situation with the exchange of dishes. The bill was brought 10 min. after request. I also saw that guests from England, after asking for an English-language menu, were ignored and had to guess what to order. As for the taste, finally - the fish is amazing, a bit too much oil on the plate, but it's ok. The fries were ok, one salad was good, the other was bland. Bad idea adding onion to flounder.

5,"We were just so lucky with the food during our week-long stay in Gdansk, and the joy was therefore great when we were served our baked potatoes at Bar Pod Ryba. it's not only the best baked potatoes we've tasted (by a huge margin), but simply super delicious food. The paws did not play a significant role in the dishes, since the filling completely dominated. It tasted heavenly!  It also doesn't hurt that it's very cheap and located in a lovely street in the old town.",Absolutely fantastic food!,"Valencia, Spain",Valencia,PJOTromss_Norway,2015-06-01
4,"We visited the restaurant recently and found the place to be very pleasant.  It had a large party of what looked like a school trip in at the time, which they seemed to deal with very well.  The service was efficient and friendly.

We both ordered jacket potatoes, which were very large.  Mine was with a bacon and cheese filling, which I expected to be a hot filling, but wasn't so was a bit of a surprise but really nice anyway.  We ordered a bottle of white wine to go with the meal and the total of the meal was 92 Zl.",Large potatoes with very generous fillings,"Wakefield, United Kingdom",Wakefield,Shar0nG1,2015-05-31

5,"This is one of the best places we've eaten at during our 2-week trip through central Europe. The variety of baked potatoes stuffed with tantalising combinations is incredible and no two taste the same. The waitresses are also very nice, always smiling, and the atmosphere is very relaxed and authentic. Strongly recommended.",Excellent food and atmosphere!,,,Mikalerim,2015-05-18
