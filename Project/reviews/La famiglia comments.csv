1,"I have dined at La Famiglia before and the pizzas were reasonable.  Yesterday I was passing by and since I knew the place and the nature called and I needed to use the toilet, I asked for using it. One of the the girls there said bluntly that I needed to pay 5 zloty. When I reacted all the staff there just laughed at me as I was leaving. I did not want to pay the bribe that's why I left.  It takes more than just selling pizzas to be really a family ( La Famiglia ) place. You may satisfy your hunger there but there is a dark side of that ""Family"".  People working there are questionable, they actually seem immature.  You never know what you can confront. I would avoid this place.   ",Dark side of The Family,,,bogieb908,2023-09-03
3,"A simple family pizzeria with a very small but cozy dining area inside. When the weather is good, it is more pleasant to sit on the terrace. 
We were guided by the very good reviews on Tripadvisor and by the price indication of ‚Ç¨ 1, and that set our expectations at a high level.
We ordered a vegetarian pizza and a meat calzone pizza.
Both pizzas were very tasty and tasty. The prices in 2023 will no longer be as cheap as the photos (from 2016) of the menu on Tripadvisor make it out. My pizza calzone cost 42 z≈Çoty.  It has become considerably more expensive in just a few years. Price-quality is still very good compared to Western European prices. 
The diverse choice of Polish beers are correctly priced. A downside was the red house wine, which disappointed on all levels.  So not recommended. Slightly dull taste, like too much water in wine.
Total bill was 115 z≈Çoty for two pizzas, a glass of house wine and a 0.5 L beer

We tried La Famiglia which was no3 at the time, it was a bit hard to find but google maps managed to get us there. 

Upon entering we felt like it was a takeaway similar to that which you would find in the uk but there were a few tables in the restaurant with condiments on them. We asked if it was going okay to take a seat to which the waitress politely replied. We took our seats and ordered shortly after - not an extensive range of pizzas but enough to pick something that we fancied.

It was cold and raining that day, so we wanted to drink tea, the menu lists several types and describes them generously - but to our surprise, there was no tea... none :d Oh well. 
Many people point out the lack of cutlery and plates - I'm surprised that the management won't invest a few pennies in such basic equipment. The waiting time was long for pizza, and the pizza itself - well... nothing special. The cake may not have been very bad, but the ingredients were few, not very expressive and of low quality. What a pity. 
Unfortunately, the praised service here was another disappointment - a waiter in sweatpants (I'll get over it) was making out with (I hope) a girl at the bar - which was quite distasteful. Conclusion - never trust only opinions on a website.
Oh... and as for the toilet, it wasn't the cleanest and unfortunately there was no soap.

3,"We were encouraged to visit this pizzeria by its high rating on Tripadvisor.
Unfortunately, the pizza has nothing to do with the original Italian pizza.
The price is high considering that we received a paper-thin crust (yes, I love thin pizza, but this was a bit of an exaggeration...).
Ingredients: nothing special, taste like from any supermarket. 'Parma' ham was a thick ham cut into pieces that could not be chewed (the piece in the photo). The cook should check how to cut this type of ham...
Moreover, despite the relatively high price, the pizza is served on paper plates.
A plus for the taste of the cake - it's ok and for the regional beer.
We are disappointed and unfortunately we will not return.

Thin crust pizza is required, no point in paying for dough, and i must say it was indeed thin, as well as tasty. For the only time in my life i ordered - as dessert you might say - a second pizza! This tells you that (a) i was rather hungry (b) the pizzas were gossamer-thin (c) i enjoyed my first one so much i went back for more!
Very fresh base, extremely more-ish and simple but effective topping. For the very reasonable prices charged i don't complain at all if the first one left me wanting more; the perfect excuse to indulge (and yes, the waitress did raise a Polish eyebrow).
Anyway, if you like a tasty pizza La Famiglia should not disappoint. Washed down with an easy house red wine, i can thoroughly recommend them.

My kids had ham and cheese which they liked. They are 7 and 12 and were a little hungry afterwards, so best to buy one pizza each which is still very cheap.

21 zlotys for a portion pizza, which wasn't super cheap for regular pizza down here.

The pizza itself has a thin, crispy crust. I think it's great, just the way I like it. Ingredients of quite good quality, aesthetically arranged on the pizza. We occupied 2 different ones. Pizza served on a wooden tray, placed on paper. 
I must write one thing with all responsibility - the pizza is delicious!
A big surprise, and a plus, is the ability to choose olive oil for pizza. We chose spicy, herbal and garlic. Great.
As befits a decent pizzeria, they do not provide cutlery. I like it, you drink the beer from a mug and eat the pizza in your hand.

One drawback - when the delivery guys were coming in and out, they left the door open and we were cold. Someone needed to stand up to go and close the door. This should not happen.

5,"We went for dinner to this tiny pizzeria located in a side street and we don't regret it. The place may not be very spacious, but there is a place. We ordered two different pizzas and both were delicious. Very thin dough, lots of ingredients, modest edges (in terms of their surface area compared to the surface of the entire pizza - this is a big advantage for us), if someone needs it, there is olive oil for pouring. The pizza is excellent :) And at an affordable price. The order processing time is very short and the service is efficient and very nice. Our Gda≈Ñsk trip welcomed us with the weather in true London style, so we chose the chef's teas for our meal - tea with raspberry juice, cloves, ginger, lemon and orange - delicious :) Tea served in 0.5l jugs - one is enough for two people, I think that someone likes tea as much as we do... Perfect to warm up after a day trip around the city.

3,"We were attracted to this place by the reviews from TripAdvisor, so we went to this pizzeria on Saturday afternoon with two families (8 people). The place is off the beaten track, with little space inside, but fortunately it has a garden across the street. We chose pizza, sandwich and salad. Medium-sized pizzas served on a wooden board with a handle on a piece of parchment, a nice touch, but unfortunately it does not save the pizza. Overall, the pizza seems to want to be Italian, but unfortunately its hard edges made it feel like we were eating a dry piece of bread. The dough lacked freshness and rise. The toppings were perfect, although even though it was an Italian pizza, there were too few of them. Caprese salad: basically what was written was on the plate, additionally sprinkled with balsamic vinegar, tasty, but too simple without any finesse. Overall, tasty, good service, but you can't see the cook's love for what he does. Just so-so pizzas and so-so salads. I think the ratings are too high, but of course I recommend the place because it has potential. I suggest playing around with pizza dough. The price is bearable for a pizza in the Old Town.","The pizza is tasty, but far from perfect","Zlotoria, Poland",Zlotoria,dexterwb,2017-08-29

2,"Generally while traveling in unknown cities, I refer to TripAdvisor reviews to select places to eat. So when I read glowing opinions about La Famiglia, I went there for dinner last night. The outdoor area was full so I sat inside which is fine. Being vegetarian, I ordered the only veggie pizza on the menu with mushrooms and tomatoes as toppings. Well, even at the fairly reasonable price of PLN21, the pizza was hardly worth the wait. In fact, more than the toppings, it wS the crust that was more delicious. Their soup of the day was tomato which I don't much fancy so I avoided it. 
The prices are very reasonable as I said earlier so even having a two or three course meal won't pinch. Service was rather impersonal and it was only at the end that the waitress bothered to ask me if my pizza was fine and gave me the faint impression of a smile. She looked too hassled and overworked according to me. I would not bother going back to La Famiglia if I ever came back to Gdansk.

5,A great place to eat a tasty pizza. There is more than enough choice (for both pizza and beer) and the waitress spoke English. The pizza was also ready in no time and tasted delicious. Definitely recommended.,"Tasty, cheap food","Horst, The Netherlands",Horst,GvdM95,2015-12-22
3,"A small place in a side street in the Old Town of Gda≈Ñsk. The decor inside is bland, in the middle there is one large table for about 8 people and a few two-person tables against the walls. When it comes to pizza, the menu includes 10 items in one size - approximately medium. What unpleasantly surprised us was the inability to replace ingredients on the pizza. It should be as it is written in the menu. The pizza itself has a thin, very good crust. One of the best I've ever eaten. Very good tea, with jam, cranberry juice and orange segments. The cutlery is only plastic and you have to ask the staff where it is because the pizza is served without it.",Good pizza,,,1wojt1,2015-11-29

3,"While sightseeing in Gda≈Ñsk, we went to La Famiglia pizzeria. The first thing we noticed was the tiny interior of the place and a tiny menu with only a few items. (the menu includes soup of the day, probably 8 types of pizza, 2 salads, dessert of the day and that's it). Because it wasn't a warm day, we couldn't use the summer garden at the pizzeria. The waitress, in response to our questions, informed us that there was no dessert of the day at all, but the soup of the day was carrot cream (for which the accompanying person thanked us). So we ordered two pizzas: the classic Capriciosa and Di Parma. We also ordered a latte and tea with lemon. The pizzas appeared on the table quite quickly. I would rate their size as something between a small and medium pizza. The cake was so thin that after eating it and still feeling hungry, we decided to order another one. The choice fell on Formaggio. Comparing all three pizzas, we found that Capriciosa was the tastiest. We liked Formaggio the least - it was fatty and we didn't notice the presence of four types of cheese. A tiny cube of gorgonzola was only on one slice of pizza. The decor of the place and its small size were probably supposed to be associated with a small Italian pizzeria, but for me it was bland. In my opinion, the place is more like a pizza bar than a restaurant (enter, eat and leave), which would be more suitable by the sea, not in the city center. The service did not make any impression - neither good nor bad. The pizzas were served on wooden boards without cutlery, napkins or olive oil. While looking around the pizzeria, we noticed that the above items were on a small table against the wall. However, the waitress did not inform about this fact. Cutlery available only in plastic version. The price of the meal was PLN 73. 
To sum up, if you are very hungry and you haven't found a better pizzeria in the area, go there. However, if you are a very hungry man, you should order two pizzas, and if you are a fat man, three. ;) :) ;)",If you must....,"Katowice, Poland",Katowice,Damian19999,2015-09-06

5,"I was looking for a good pizza in Gda≈Ñsk for a really long time, comparable to the ones you can eat in Italy. After a dozen or so attempts, I started trying ""homemade"" ones - all to no avail. We finally found LaFamiglia, where the pizza is thin and ALL crispy. Well-added compositions - everyone will find something for themselves. The prices are really attractive considering the very center. Service without being bloated - nothing to complain about.",True Italian,,,TomekK700,2015-09-04
5,"Sometimes you have to go down a side street to get the best experiences. Likewise with La Famiglia. If you like pizza and are in Gdansk, you simply have to visit this place. The pizza tasted so good here that we also had to share a pizza for dessert. The only slight disappointment was the wine list. The house wine, which was the only offer, was simply not good. We hope the owners have corrected this by our next visit!","Glad i pizza, dra hit!","Oslo, Norway",Oslo,Arnfrid500,2015-08-29

I don't know if they have other dishes on the menu but the pizza is impressive. Thin dough with an incredible flavor. In my case I ordered a diavola and I seasoned it with homemade spicy oil that they have there.

We sat at the terrace and it was very pleasant and relaxing‚Ä¶just 75 meters away from the hectic Dluga Street. It certainly was not the tourist trap it seems to be being that close to tourist areas.

5,"Pizzeria La Famiglia is a recently opened place in the Old Town of Gda≈Ñsk. They advertise themselves as a place serving real Italian pizza. I decided to check.

Thin dough, perfectly baked and crispy. Spread with a sauce based on natural tomatoes, which are noticeable in it. The dough is not soggy from the sauce. Cheese was placed on top of the sauce and then melted. The prepared pancake only contained Parma ham and arugula, as well as unmelted pieces of Parmesan cheese.  

The pizza is not large, but it is delicious. The dough is perfect, the Parma ham is real. Olive oil is served with the pizza. The only thing we can complain about is too little tomato sauce on the pancake (it was not evenly distributed), but this is a minor thing that can be compensated relatively easily. The undoubted advantage of this place are the prices. Pizza Di Parma does not differ in quality and taste from its competitor counterparts, and it is much cheaper. The disadvantage of the place is that it is very small and the lack of air conditioning makes it hot (the pizza oven is close to the tables). 

However, I definitely recommend it!",La Famighlia... another real Italian pizzeria in Gda≈Ñsk,"Gdansk, Poland",Gdansk,WOBON,2014-07-31
