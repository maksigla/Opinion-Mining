2,"We have been here on every visit to Gdansk, and we were looking forward to another visit.
It was a disappointment. We were served by a waitress who was neither cheerful nor welcoming. We asked her about a drink we saw they served and wondered what it was, she answered grumpily that she didn't know, because it wasn't her who served it. Then we got a cold burger that didn't have the same quality as before at all. It didn't taste good.
When we were to pay, we were to pay in cash. We gave her 200 sloty, when the bill came to about 110. She then asked sourly if we should have change left. Then it was enough, we finally got change again, didn't give a tip (we always do that) and hurried out.

5,"During our weekend stay in Gda≈Ñsk, we had the pleasure of visiting Billy's restaurant and I would like to share our experience. The first thing that impressed us was that we were welcomed with our dog, which, unfortunately, is not always possible in other places. The waiters were very polite and got us a table out of the way, which was especially nice considering the restaurant was packed and people were standing in line waiting to be seated. we appreciated the fact that the staff took care of our comfort so that our dog did not disturb other guests. We cannot have any objections to the waiter himself, Piotr, who served us. His professionalism, smile on his face and willingness to talk made us feel really welcome. We understand how difficult it can be to serve guests in a full restaurant, but Piotr still took the time to take care of us and make sure everything was OK. As a former waiter, I appreciate the difficult job that restaurant staff do, and Piotr was an excellent an example of professionalism and a positive approach to work. Thanks to him, our visit to Billy's Restaurant was exceptionally pleasant and I am happy to recommend this place and Piotr 
As for food, my wife and I ordered two California steaks, and I must say that we were delighted with their taste.

It was so tasteless, unsalted and so boring. Well fried and quite juicy though. But how difficult can it be, maybe some spices or a quality cheese that tastes something? The barbecue sauce as a side dish in a cup was the only thing that tasted of anything, guess it wasn't their own. No response at all other than a shrug when I complained that my burger didn't taste like anything. If you don't care about feedback that you give directly on the spot to the staff, then you can write here. Absolutely the only and last time for us!",Not worth the money.

2,"The atmosphere was not that nice. The restaurant was very noisy, dirty and not that cozy. Food was okay, but not that special, so i wouldn't come here again for the food. The value for money was low here. Food is kind of expensive compared to other restaurants in other parts of the city. They also changed the television channel in the middle of our dinner into some hard core mma where blood was spilling (the tv was right in front of us) and it really spoilled our apetite :( (sorry) I would recommend for everyone to go to restaurants rather in D≈Çuga street or somewhere else in the centrum.

2,"This was our second visit to this restaurant. We liked the dishes and the decor the first time, it was about a year ago, so we came again. We ordered onion rings and chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãsoup for an appetizer, and burgers for a second course. I'm a vegetarian and my husband has a different one with meat. Unfortunately, the onion in the onion rings was extremely hard, making them difficult to eat. The breading was ok, the sauce was also ok. Then came the vegetarian burger and unfortunately neither I nor my husband (he had medium rare meat) liked it. I don't know if it was the bun or the ingredients inside, but it was simply impossible to eat it completely. The fries were ok. I don't even give it 3 stars because the service also sucked. Our waiter only appeared at the beginning and at the end, and after a long time of eating, when we wanted to order something, we couldn't even look at him and had to go to someone else to order a drink. Maybe this is nitpicking, but waiting 20 minutes to order lemonade plus waiting time for it was not pleasant. I will also point out that there were not many people there that day. Out of curiosity, you can go to this restaurant, but unfortunately we will not visit there again, especially since there is so much competition in the Tricity and there are many more interesting culinary items.",Disappointment after a second visit.,,,474magdaw,2024-02

The restaurant is decorated like an old American style diner and is very authentic looking, quirky red leather booths and checked table cloths. Ordered drinks. Aperol Spritz for me and beer for Mr H. The Aperol Spritz comes out fizzing which is very cool! Chicken tenders to start to share which were ok.. but I didn‚Äôt eat many as I thought they were slightly on the under done side but they were ok. That is I‚Äôm afraid where the positives ended, Mr H got steak and baked potato, the steak was poor and the baked potatoes looked like they‚Äôd been sitting out for days and then given a quick grill. My salad was very basic and the halloumi in it also felt like it had seen better days. Mr H was still hungry as he hadn‚Äôt ate much of the steak and potatoes so ordered the deep fried Mars bar‚Ä¶ but again it came out warm and seemed to have been sitting and reheated‚Ä¶ the food was just not great!

Upon arrival we were greeted with a lovely, handsome fella who smelt devine. We sat down, ordered drinks and looked at the menu. I was with my girlfriend and initially thought that this would be the perfect spot to propose to her until the unexpected happened.

She ordered ‚Äúbeef‚Äù fajitas. If Polish beef is the same as the rubber sole of my shoe, then I guess it was beef but I don‚Äôt think it was. 

She was open minded and began chewing before disaster struck. Death was imminent. She began coughing profusely on the ‚Äúbeef‚Äù before a whole strip rose up through her throat and skelped me in the face.

3,"Restaurant No. 1 according to Trip Advisor, so a great choice for an anniversary trip with my wife. But is it really? The atmosphere of the place is pleasant, American style, with a beautiful view from the granary island. Unlimited quantities of popcorn for an appetizer - cool. First course - appetizer, Chorizo ‚Äã‚Äãsoup. Very tasty, with character, definitely too sweet to drink, a non-alcoholic drink, my wife took watermelon lemonade and that's the first failure, rude, super sweet syrup, it wasn't even next to the watermelon, I wonder if they also make lemonade from some lemon syrup, especially at this price. We took the iconic sets, my wife had classic ribs with pineapple, everything was beautiful in the photo but in reality she verified it, not much glaze, the ribs were soft and nicely falling off the bones, the salad was the most ordinary in the world and the potato was tasteless, if it weren't for the cottage cheese it would have been terrible, aaaand I would have forgotten , the grilled pineapple was from a can, in the middle of the season when you can get fresh pineapples in a dish for PLN 80, we have a small slice canned pineapple. My burger was okay, the meat was ground too fine in my opinion, and the bun was great, there was no sesame, the fries were very good. For dessert, Mars in cake, Mars itself is super sweet, plain cake, very good vanilla ice cream, nasty cream that tastes like those from spray cans. Plus for the idea and courage for Mars. For an average eater, such cuisine may be tasty because it is fatty and overly sweet, but for more demanding customers it is definitely not. The service deserves a lot of praise, Ms. Olga was very professional, nice, sincere and friendly, she approached us several times and asked how we liked it, after the starter she asked if we could serve main courses, which was very nice, she gave us good advice and finally accepted from us all feedback and promised to share our opinion to improve the quality. I hope that the quality will improve because the position in the ranking is obligatory and for me this visit should place this restaurant below the top ten.

The meals are all impressive visually and well presented ,freshly cooked and tasty. The kitchen pass is visible from the tables.
The drinks are equally as impressive ,my partners drink was spectacular creating smoke (some sort of vapour!) from the glass . In the restaurant they have a popcorn maker and this adds the aroma of caramelised sugar.
All the dishes look great ,my choice was a burger which was very filling .We also chose dessert which again did not disappoint (warm chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream).
The location was also enjoyable on the waterfront but was incredibly busy between 7.00pm and 8.00pm as you would expect.  ",Good food and entertainment!,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",Newcastle upon Tyne,RobinH955,2023-07

5,"Let me start by saying that my wife hates cheese. None. And even more so the mold that was in the burger. 
We were served by a waitress named Natalia. Already at the beginning of the conversation I knew that we had come to the right place with both the place and the service. As I mentioned, my wife hates cheese. Mrs. Natalia, even though she knew about it, offered her wife a burger with blue cheese, although it was supposed to be something with chicken. Since I can eat anything, we decided to take the risk and as my wife said: ""I have never eaten a better burger..."".
I was unsure between the ribs and the burger. Without hesitation, Mrs. Natalia's answer was ribs and I was not disappointed!! Championship! 
On the second day, encouraged by the delicious food and service, we returned. I took the Rokefeler burger (delicious!) and my wife took the chicken (it was ok.)
Unfortunately, the service left a lot to be desired.

To sum up. If we come to Gda≈Ñsk again, we will definitely visit this place! 
Ms. Natalia's service, even though the sign said ""I'm learning"", deserves praise. I have been working in the catering industry for 15 years and it is really rare to meet people with such an approach. Casual but professional. Polish gastronomy needs such people :)

See you !!!
